# Video Thumbnail

Video Thumbnail is an Omeka S module that allows automatic thumbnail generation for video files with frame selection capabilities.

## Features

- Automatically generates thumbnails for video files (MP4, MOV) during upload
- Provides a user interface to select specific frames from videos to use as thumbnails
- Includes a batch processing job to regenerate thumbnails for all videos in the site
- Integrates with Omeka S's existing media management system

## Requirements

- Omeka S (tested with versions 3.x and 4.x)
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- FFmpeg (must be installed on the server)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the module into the `modules` directory
3. Rename the unzipped directory to `VideoThumbnail`
4. Install the module from the admin panel

## Configuration

After installation, navigate to the module's configuration page:

1. Set the path to the FFmpeg executable (e.g., `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`)
2. Configure the number of frames to extract for selection (default: 5)
3. Set the default frame position as a percentage of video duration (default: 10%)

## Usage

### Uploading Videos

When you upload a video file (MP4 or MOV), the module automatically generates a thumbnail using the default frame position.

### Selecting a Different Frame

To select a different frame as the thumbnail:

1. Navigate to the media edit page
2. Scroll down to the "Video Thumbnail" section
3. Click "Select Frame"
4. Choose from the available frames
5. Click "Select" under your preferred frame

### Batch Processing

To regenerate thumbnails for all videos:

1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. Click on the "Add a new job" link in the notification
3. Select "VideoThumbnail\Job\ExtractFrames" from the job type dropdown
4. Click "Submit"

The job will run in the background and update all video thumbnails.

## Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed and the path is correctly set in the configuration.
- **No frames appear**: Check if the video file is readable by the server and is in a supported format.
- **Job processing errors**: Check the job logs for detailed error messages.
